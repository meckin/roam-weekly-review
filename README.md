# Readme

I've forked `kylestratis/roam-weekly-review` as it worked with Alfred, this logic is highly out of date. Since Roam has Smartblocks, you can create this template 100% within roam and there no use for Alfred + textexpander. 

The framework is also semi- Nat Eliason weekly review forked too.


# roam-weekly-review

This review has the following sections:
* What did I do this week? - This is a query of all done TODO items from the week you are reviewing. 
* Review Questions - Questions to ask yourself as you review the previous week. 
* Post-Review Retrospective - Questions to find areas of improvement for the coming week.

## Installation
- Install Smartblocks within your roams /js 
- Add the text below to your /template page 

## Output
An example output looks like this: 
```
- #42SmartBlock Weekly Plan 
    - # Week:: [[ <%DATE:today%> ]]
        - __Weekly Review:: [[Weekly Review <%DATE:today%>]]__
        - ## Pages to Reference
            - Go through these to find priorities for upcoming week.
            - [[TODO]]
            - [[Goals]]
